Contact form generator
======================

In almost every app I create there is a contact form. Since I repeat the same steps 
over and over I decided to create a contact form generator.

The generator gives you a good starting point for further modifications. 
Specs will be generated if Rspec is available.


Dependencies: ActiveForm plugin


Installation
============

script/plugin install git://github.com/cs/active_form.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/masone/contact-form-generator.git


Example
=======

* Run the generator
  script/generate contact_form

* Configure the mail recipient settings in app/models/contact_mailer.rb

* Go to http://yourapp/contact
